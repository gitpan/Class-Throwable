    - win32 compatibility patch 

0.10 Sun Dec 12 2004
    - changed the output format to a more compact
      (each stack frame takes one line rather than 6)
        - altered tests to accomidate this
        - added example output to the docs

0.09 Tues Nov 30 2004
    - added the 'retrofit' capabilities, see the docs for 
      more information about this
        - added 't/50_Class_Throwable_retrofit_test.t' 
          to test this functionality

0.08 Fri Nov 26 2004
    - still trying to fix some platform specific issues
      with the tests.

0.07 Wed Nov 24 2004
    - my fix for the test files was wrong (I have to admit
      I didnt test it on the other platforms, I was lazy, 
      but the bad kind of lazy). This should work now.

0.06 Wed Nov 24 2004
    - fixed some test files which were failing because
      of platform specific path seperators, no other code
      has been changed.
    - changed Makefile.PL to have 'use 5.006' in it to assure
      that this is only run with modern perls.

0.05 Thurs Nov 18 2004
    - now using Scalar::Util::blessed() instead of 
      the convoluted UNIVERSAL::isa() stuff. 
      - added Scalar::Util as a dependency

0.04 Mon Oct 4 2004	
    - I changed the way Verbosity is handled. Removing
      the $Class::Throwable::VERBOSE variable, in favor
      of a more flexible alternative. 
        - added tests and docs for this

0.03 Fri Oct 1 2004
	- added the new method, and altered how throw 
	  handles things
		- added tests for this
